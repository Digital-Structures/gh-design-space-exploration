[0.4.7 - 2013/05/28]
+ Added missing Splines property to access the splines list of the DxfDocument.
+ Added missing Dimensions property to access the dimensions list of the DxfDocument.

[0.4.6 - 2013/05/16]

+ Rename DxfDocument.PolyfaceMesh property to DxfDocument.PolyfaceMeshes.
+ The entity Normal property is now part of the EntityObject base class.
+ (fixed) Polyline IsClosed property.
+ (fixed) Write polyface meshes with a number of vertexes less than three.

[0.4.5 - 2013/05/10]
+ Workaround buggy dxf files with entities that references table objets not defined in the tables section. This only applies to application registries, layers, line types, text styles, dimension styles and mline styles, if necessary a new one with default values will be created.

[0.4.4 - 2013/05/08]
+ Added Add and Get application registries methods.
+ (fixed) Bug in Get table object by name methods.
+ (fixed) Table dictionaries keys will ignore case as it should have been from day one. The names of layers, line types, text styles,... are case insensitive.
+ (fixed) Workarounds for bugs on programs that generate dxfs with duplicate table object names. Duplicate table objects will be skipped.
+ (fixed) Issue Id #11725 CheckDimBlockName. Added check that dimension blocks and group names starts with "*D" and "*A" respectively while reading dxfs.

[0.4.3 - 2013/04/16]

+ (fixed) Issue Id #11698 DxfReader->ReadEntities -> ReadEntity.
+ (fixed) Issue Id #11702 Issue with position of insert attributes.

[0.4.2 - 2013/04/07]
+ Read and write comments only at the head of the dxf file.
+ Workaround/fixes due to inconsistences on dxf files generated by Sketchup and EASE. Now during the attribute initialization all attribute definition properties will be copied, so any changes made to the attribute definition will only be applied to new attribute instances and not to existing ones. This is due to some dxf files might generate INSERT entities that contains attributes that are not defined in the BLOCK, eventhought it might be incorrect, strictly speaking, AutoCad allows this behaviour.
+ (fixed) AutoCad was giving an error with the LastSavedBy Header variable, this variable is not recongnized by AutoCad2000.
+ (fixed) Issue Id #11690 Insert Entity Scale.
+ (fixed) Error reading color in ReadVertex() method.

+ The AciColor rgb to index conversion might be a little more accurate now.
+ Added AciColor conversions from and to HSL (hue, saturation, lightness).
+ Deleted parameter DxfVersion from the Save() method of the DxfDocument. Now it is handled by the AcadVer property of the DrawingVariables property of the DxfDocument.
+ DxfDocument.Load() methods are now static, they will return null if errors are found during the loading process.
+ Deleted FileInfo property from the DxfDocument.
+ Updated "netDxf Documentation.chm".

+ Feature request Id #11537 Add support for RGB colors (group code 420). Layers and entities now support true colors.
+ Now you can access the full list of indexed colors.
+ Added linetype scale property (group code 48) to all entities.
+ Added object visibility property (group code 60) to all entities.
+ Added rotation property (group code 50) to Point entity.

[0.2.7 - 2013/01/29]
+ Hatches now supports spline as boundary paths.
+ Added SplineVertex constructor with Vector2.
+ Dropped the restriction to use only ASCII characters, now the StreamReader will always use Encoding.Default the equivalent to ANSI_1252 defined in the $DWGCODEPAGE header variable of the dxf file.
+ Deleted ClassDiagram.cd from project.
+ Deleted lots of if(dxfPairInfo.Code == #) statements from Reader.ReadEdgeBoundaryPath(int numEdges) since they are no really need it. The way hatch boundary paths are defined is very strict, you must follow exactly the order and number of elements that appear in the documentation.
+ (fixed) Saving files that has been loaded from a file without defined RasterVariables object.

[0.2.6 - 2013/01/28]
+ Added Image entity.

+ Rename Text.BasePoint, MText.InsertionPoint and AttributeDefinition.BasePoint, Block.BasePoint, and Insert.InsertionPoint to .Position.
+ The attribute normal will use the ones applied to the Insert entity to which it belongs, this is subject to change if I find a way to get predictable results.
+ Updated "netDxf Documentation.chm".
+ (fixed) Insertions, Attributes and Text entities follows the same rules as the Circle, Arc, Ellipse and MText entities. The insertion point (position), defines the placement in world coordinates and the normal defines the orientation of the insertion at that point (this will only affect to entities which normal is not the default ZAxis).
+ (fixed) Text aligment in block attributes.

[0.2.4 - 2012/12/19]
+ Now the entity handles are assigned when the entity is added to the document. This should allow to open an existing dxf and add more entities to the same document, while maintaining the old entity handles once the document is saved again.
+ Added Plot property to layers, If set to false, do not plot this layer.
+ Added RemoveEntity method to the DxfDocument.
+ Deleted Layer, Color, and LineType properties from PolyfaceMeshFace, PolyfaceMeshVertex, and PolylineVertex.

[0.2.3 - 2012/12/14]
+ Added read and write Linear Dimensions.
+ Added read and write Radial Dimensions.
+ Added read and write Diametric Dimensions.
+ Added read and write 3 Point Angular Dimensions.
+ Added read and write 2 Line Angular Dimensions.
+ Added read and write Ordinate Dimensions.
The dimension style definition is very limited and the drawing might be buggy under some circunstances (it is sensitive in the order the reference points are given and/or offset negative values).
+ Updated "netDxf Documentation.chm".
+ (fixed) Read code 70 in LwPolylines.
+ (fixed) Read hatch with solid pattern fill.
+ (fixed) Read AttributeDefinition width factor.
+ minor fixes and cleanup.

[0.2.2 - 2012/11/21]
+ Delete property aligment from block attributes, it did not seem to change anything and it was not recognized by AutoCAD 2005 generating an error. AutoCAD 2005 was not able to load a 2004 dxf generated by AutoCAD 2012. It did not recognized the aligment codes.
+ Cleaned up entity constructors.
+ Added entity constructors with Vector2.
+ Added read and write Aligned Dimensions.
- (fixed) AciColor negative index issue when loading files.

[0.2.1 - 2012/11/16] 
+ Added MTEXT entity, with basic text formatting.
+ Move TextAlligment to the netDxf.enties namespace.
+ (fixed) The default text style (Standard) must be the first on the table list.

[0.2.0 - 2012/10/12] 
+ Dropped support for AutoCAD12 dxf files this will break your program if you are using polylines. Important: following the way the dxf calls the polyline entities:
1. - LightWeightPolyline has been renamed LwPolyline for short.
2. - All Polylines are now LwPolylines.
3. - All Polylines3d are now Polylines.
Also the entities LwPolyline, Polyline and PolyfaceMesh have their own list in the DxfDocument, before they all were included in the same list "Polylines".
+ Updated "netDxf Documentation.chm".

[0.1.6.0 - 2012/09/28]
+ Read and write hatches to dxf, there are a few predefined patterns based on AutoCAD pat file. You can create your own providing the information needed for the HatchPatternLineDefinition class or load from a file (same rules as AutoCAD pat files are applied).
+ Line types can be loaded form a file but only simple line patterns are supported (same rules as AutoCAD lin files are applied).
+ Text files reorganization: changelog.txt and license.txt move to doc folder together with the compiled HTML help file.
+ Updated "netDxf Documentation.chm".
+ Added AutoCad2010 database version number.
+ (fixed) Renamed the PolylineVertex and LightweightPolylineVertex StartThickness and EndThickness as StartWidth and EndWidth, it should always be this way. Do not confuse Elevation, Width and Thickness of an entity. I try to follow the AutoCAD documentation as close as possible, please check it in case of doubt or as in this case I might be wrong. 
+ (fixed) Read and write ellipse entity.
+ (fixed) To make it easier and to unify concepts, the center of a circle, an arc and an ellipse are always given in world coordinates, even though the dxf gives the center of the circle and the arc in object coordinates, and the center of the ellipse in world coordinates. The local (to the center) orientation of the entity will be given by the normal.

[0.1.5.0 - 2012/09/21]
+ With limitations now you can write hatches in dxf files.
+ Removed the limitations of the bulge in polyline vertexes, it can actually be greater than 1 and lower than -1 (1 represents the semicircle and the negative sign if the arc goes in or out).

[0.1.4.0 - 2012/09/11]
+ Vector2f, Vector3f, Matrix3f are no loger needed - removed
+ Vector2d renamed to Vector2
+ Vector3d renamed to Vector3
+ Matrix3d renamed to Matrix3

+ Changed all numeric data of the library to use doubles instead of floats
+ Solution updated to Visual Studio 2010

[0.1.2.0 - 2009/03/07]
+ Added support for AutoCad12, AutoCad2000, AutoCad2004 and AutoCad2007 dxf files
+ The Ellipse entity will be exported as a true ellipse for dxf file version AutoCad2000 and higher
+ Due to the need of keeping unique handles for entities, duplicate objets will not be allowed
+ Added this change log information
+ Added Lightweight entity
+ Lots of internal changes and new classes
+ NurbsCurves will not be allowed temporally, it needs more work to be able to export them as true splines in AutoCad200 and higher dxf files

[0.1.1.0 - 2009/03/01]
+ Added Ellipse entity that will be exported as a polyline in AutoCad12 dxf files
